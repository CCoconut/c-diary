# p-diary
This is a CLI diary program written in python. It can open and write to text files but it can't edit files (that would kind of defeat the point of a diary). It also writes an entry log file that keeps track of which dates have an entry written for them.

The build folder contains the executable version of p-diary. It is only designed to run on linux systems so far, and it has to be run from the terminal.

As of version 0.3 it can now manage multiple diaries, each with their own directories.
