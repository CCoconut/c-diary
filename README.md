# c-diary
This is a CLI diary program written in python. It can open and write to text files but it can't edit files (that would kind of defeat the point of a diary). It also writes an entry log file that keeps track of which dates have an entry written for them.

Make sure to be consistent with what directory you use or else your entries will be all over the place.
